Turns out he ended up getting too friendly with the teddy bear. If I look like a man who made love to his wife last night – it's because I almost did. Heart attack never stopped old Big Bear. I didn't even know we were calling him Big Bear. We never had the chance to. They're not gonna strip, right? I told them not to, but I can't guarantee their instincts won't kick in. So you take your mom to work every day? Bummer. Moms are such a pain in the ass, huh? It's, like, die already!

I am getting rid of this thing. It has caused me nothing but pride and self-respect. No, Pop-pop does not get a treat. I just bought you a f**king pizza.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
